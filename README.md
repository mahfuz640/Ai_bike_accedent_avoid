# 🚲 AI Bike Accident Avoidance & Alert System

An AI-powered smart bike safety system using computer vision, sensors, and IoT technologies.  
YOLOv8 performs real-time detection of persons and vehicles from a live camera feed.  
Obstacle distance is measured using an ultrasonic sensor to dynamically control motor speed.  
An accelerometer detects accidents or abnormal tilt and instantly stops the motor.  
In emergencies, the system sends an automatic SMS with live GPS location and provides a web-based live camera dashboard.
